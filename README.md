# NBA players' performance analysis
This is a statistical analysis testing the hypothesis whether life experiences have an incremental impact on an athletes' statistical performance. In here, I focused on the performance of pro players from National Basketball Association (NBA). The data I used here were scrapped from https://www.basketball-reference.com.

## Framework
● Life experience is defined as either an engagement, marriage, divorce, birth/adoption and death of a family membber.
● This is a time cound study where the performance of the players were compared as the month before and the month after the event. 


For example, Dwayne Wade, SG for the Miami Heat, became engaged to actress Gabrielle Union on December 21, 2013.
